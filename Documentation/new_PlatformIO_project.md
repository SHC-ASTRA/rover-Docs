# Setting up new PlatformIO projects
PlatformIO is the VSCode plugin that ASTRA uses for embedded development as a replacement for Arduino IDE. This document outlines the steps necessary for setting up a new platformIO project for embedded development. There are guidelines and necessary imports for properly utilizing ASTRA's standardized embedded libraries.

## New Project
### Start a new project
(TBD: navigate to the plugin, choose new project)
### Select location 
(TBD: place inside the desired repo. The project will make a new directory with the name of the project)
### Choose MCU appropriately
(TBD: Select proper MCU for the project, IMPORTANT)
### Add import for the astra-Embedded-Libs repo
(TBD: Add link to astra-Embedded-Libs so you get access to necessary libraries, functions, and classes)
### Import in main?
(TBD: Unsure if this step will be necessary but add here if needed)
