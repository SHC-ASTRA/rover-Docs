# Software Requirements 
  Before downloading anything, it is a good idea to make sure your system is up to date and that all software you are using is as well. If you are on Ubuntu/Debian, the following commands will do so. 
  
  All commands in this document will be for Ubuntu.
  
  ```
  sudo apt-get install && sudo apt-get upgrade
  ```
## ROS2 Humble
We use ROS2(Robot Operating System) Humble, and plan on using that until support for it expires. 

If you are not using Ubuntu/Debian, go to the [ROS2 Website](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html) to know how to install ROS2, otherwise you can use the setup script ros2_install.sh provided under scripts in ASTRA's rover-Docs repo.
